# RandomQuoteGenerator
Developed 30/1/2017. Last Version 1/5/2017

A single-page app that generates random quotes and (optionally) posts them to Twitter!

Developed for the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development Certification.

This simple web app leverages the Programming Quotes API developed by <a href="http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/">Storm Consultancy UK</a> to generate a random quote. The web app then enables the user to tweet the quote (or a truncated version thereof if the Twitter character count is exceeded).

The website has two interaction points; the "Get Quote" button and the "Tweet!" button.

Sample screen outputs:

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="FqpIr6U"><a href="//imgur.com/FqpIr6U">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Future work:

-Develop custom quote API and integrate within app as a fully-fledged project.

-Resolve mixed content issues in Chrome. Testing currently limited to Firefox due to less strict mixed-content handling.
